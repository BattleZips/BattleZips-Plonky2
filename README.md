# BattleZips-Plonky2
BattleZips-Plonky2 is the culmination of 18 months of R&D on the used of proof-carrying data (PCD) recursion for a novel privacy/ scalability construction. ZK State Channels work cohesively with L2 solutions like roll-ups to achieve superior scaling properties. They also use recursive zero knowledge proving to entirely obscure the execution details. The final "ZK State Channel Proof" is posted onchain in a single transaction with instant finality. This proof should then be used as a generic (private) state object that informs further EVM execution.

Features:
  * Must be a sequential computation at the top level (recursive state channels ("state channels of state channels") allow parallelism, but battleships is an elementary case with no subchannels)
  * Validium-style transaction batching where data is not available onchain
  * Use ZK Circuit logic to build ordered state without the need for any sequencer or intermediate state witness
  * Build state to pre-determined "end conditions" which must be met before a "channel close" proof can be built
  * Notarize integrity of state execution with INSTANT FINALITY on EVM chains when posting "channel close" proof
  * Use recursive ZK shielding on "channel close" proof to shield ALL private state, exporting only the winner and loser
  * Use "channel close" proofs as generic state objects for further onchain (or offchain) actions (battleship ex: inform elo scores)

Caveat: ZK State Channels remedy the optimistic trust assumptions of legacy state channels in all cases except liveliness failures. Further R&D is needed to design a sufficiently resilient and decentralized mechanism that minimizes reliance on a third party.

## TODO
### Game Proofs 
 - [x] board proof
 - [x] shot proof
 - [x] recursive zk shielding

### State Channel Proofs
 - [x] channel open proof
 - [x] channel state increment proof 
 - [ ] channel close proof (AKA "ZK State Channel Proof")
 - [ ] example case of full PoC battleship state channel (show the full generation of a ZK State Channel Proof with instant finality)

### EVM Settlement
 - [ ] plonky2-circom wrapping of state channel plonky2 snark proof in a circom groth16 snark proof
 - [ ] refactor [BattleZips chaincode](https://github.com/BattleZips/BattleZips-Circom/blob/master/contracts/BattleshipGame.sol) to settle games in one tx

### Other Improvements
 - [ ] refactor shots to be serialized before input (optional)
 - [ ] refactor board proof to use [BattleZips-Halo2](https://github.com/BattleZips/BattleZips-Halo2) style bitmap comparisons instead of random access gate (optional)
 - [ ] ECC-based identity encryption (required for MVP)
 - [ ] add hash salt to make board commitment computationally binding (required for MVP)
 - [ ] add merkle tree to nullify shot coordinates so they can only be made once per game (required for MVP)
 - [ ] R&D employing a polynomial commitment to make board commitments pefectly hiding (optional)
 - [ ] add utils for reading and writing proof data to buffers for storage in tests/ p2p proof exchange (required for MVP)
 - [ ] add ELO scores to chaincode to demonstrate public quantitative scores from private qualitative state to measure performance (required for MVP)
 - [ ] refactor BattleZips solidity harness from Hardhat to Foundry (optional)
 - [ ] recursive shielding to hide length of state channel (optional)

## Steps
### Channel Open Proof
1. host generates a board proof
2. guest generates a board proof
3. host verifies integrity of both board proofs and creates channel open proof with initial game state as "public" outputs
### Channel State Increment Proof
1. verify previous state increment proof (including the channel open proof)
2. verify the inner shot proof for the turn
3. extract hit from shot proof, extract turn, host/guest damage from previous state increment proof
4. multiplex damage increment for host or guest with turn boolean as selector and add hit boolean
5. extract shot, commitment from both the previous state increment and inner shot proof
6. multiplex the commitment from prev shot proof being checked using the turn boolean as a selector (host or guest)
7. copy constrain the commitment and serialized shot from previous state increment proof and shot proof
8. serialize next shot for subsequent state increment proofs to prove against
9. flip turn boolean
10. export public outputs
  - copy board commitments from previous shot proof
  - register new damage counts from multiplexed hit expresion
  - register flipped turn boolean
  - register next shot
### Channel Close Proof
